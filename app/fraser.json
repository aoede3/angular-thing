        "description": "The bag is perfect for a DSLR with a prime lens and a battery grip. I’ve even fit my 5DMkii with a battery grip and my Canon 24-70 f2.8 L simply by removing the divider padding. Since that’s a big lens, the interior space is completely maxed out. But all of my prime lenses fit with extra room. If you don’t use a battery grip, you’ve got even more space.",
